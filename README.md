1.  **`dist/`**: Temporary file that gets generated by Parcel. This directory contains all of the project production ready files

2.  **`node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that the project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed

3.  **`public/`**: Contains static files. This directory is almost never touched

4.  **`src`**: This directory contains the working files. This is where you will be working most of the time

5.  **`README.md`** A text file containing useful reference information about the project

6.  **`package.json`** A manifest file for Node.js, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for the project and which scripts to run

7.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track or maintain a version history

8.  **`packgage-lock.json`** This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of the npm dependencies that were installed for the project. **(You won’t change this file directly)**

MORE DOCUMENTATION TO ADD

## 💫 Deployment

2. Drag the content inside the `dist/` directory and drop it in the hosting
